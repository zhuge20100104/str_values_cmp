# Str Value Compare Project

## Background

Since we want to compare the source XML generated by developer and the corresponding files provided by the translation company. We build this project.

## Usage 

Provide the source xml file offered by developers, then the destination file, it can run the comparison process and give you corresponding result.
```shell
python str_value_compare.py --source {Source CSV file} --source_col {Source Column Name} --dest {Dest Translation file} --dest_col {Dest Column Name}
```

Assume that you have a source_value.csv file from Android Studio, a dest_values.csv file from the translation team, the source column in the source_value.csv is "en", the destination column in the dest_values.csv is "en(English)", you can run the script as belows to get the details of it.
 
A typical usage as belows,
```shell
    python str_value_compare.py --source ./source_value.csv --source_col "en" --dest ./dest_values.csv --dest_col "en(English)"
```

Result is as belows,
